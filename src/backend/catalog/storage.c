 * a relation is created, we create the physical file immediately, but
 * remember it so that we can delete the file again if the current
 * transaction is aborted.  Conversely, a deletion request is NOT
 * executed immediately, but is just entered in the list.  When and if
 * the transaction commits, we can delete the physical file.
 *
 * To handle subtransactions, every entry is marked with its transaction
 * nesting level.  At subtransaction commit, we reassign the subtransaction's
 * entries to the parent nesting level.  At subtransaction abort, we can
 * immediately execute the abort-time actions for all entries of the current
 * nesting level.
 *
 * NOTE: the list is kept in TopMemoryContext to be sure it won't disappear
 * unbetimes.  It'd probably be OK to keep it in TopTransactionContext,
 * but I'm being paranoid.
